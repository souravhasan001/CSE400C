# Dry Fish Classification and Explainable AI

This repository contains a web-based application for classifying dry fish images and providing explainable AI (XAI) visualizations using Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and Eigen-CAM. The application is built with Streamlit and PyTorch.

## Demo App: 
- Link: [(https://capstonec-xai.streamlit.app/)](https://capstonec-xai.streamlit.app/)

## Features
- **Dry Fish Classification**: Uses a MobileNetV2 model trained on 11 different dry fish categories.
- **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Provides Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and Eigen-CAM visualizations for model interpretability.
- **User-Friendly UI**: Built with Streamlit for easy image upload and analysis.
- **Custom Styling**: Right-side background is light gray with black text for better readability.

## Installation
To set up and run the application, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Pip
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dry-fish-classification.git
cd dry-fish-classification
```

### Install Dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Application
```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

## Model
- **Architecture**: MobileNetV2, YOLOV9, YOLOV10, YOLOV11, YOLOV12
- **Dataset**: 11 categories of dry fish images
- **Explainability**: Uses Grad-CAM techniques to highlight important regions for classification

## Usage
1. Upload an image of a dry fish.
2. The model predicts the category of the fish.
3. XAI visualizations (Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, Eigen-CAM) are generated to show model decision areas.
4. Predictions and visualizations are displayed in the interface.
